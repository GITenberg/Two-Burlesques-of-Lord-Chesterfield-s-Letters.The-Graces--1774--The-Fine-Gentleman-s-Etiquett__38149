<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a>INTRODUCTION</h2>


<p>Even though the disasters which overtook John Stubbs and William Prynne
in the days of Elizabeth and Charles I no longer faced the pamphleteer,
the eighteenth century saw many an anonymous publication, for while
hands and ears were less in jeopardy, author and publisher might well
suffer imprisonment, as William Cooley and the printer of the Daily Post
learned in the winter of 1740-41, and John Wilkes in the 1760's. One can
understand why, despite the absence of personal danger, a public figure
like Lord Chesterfield should yet conceal his connection with a piece on
the Hanoverian troops, or why Horace Walpole might often not put his
name to an item listed in his Short Notes of his life or young Boswell
to his communications to the press. Indeed, many an innocuous writing
appeared anonymously, for the bashful author, protected against the
miseries of conspicuous failure, could always shyly acknowledge a
successful production. Later, perchance, it could appear in his
collected works.</p>

<p class="para2">The two pieces here reprinted, typical verse pamphlets of the 1770's,
illustrate both a type of writing and an age. The subject of both is
contemporary&mdash;the best-selling <i>Letters to his Son</i> of Lord
Chesterfield. The method falls between burlesque and caricature; the aim
is amusement; the substance is negligible. Neither poem made more than a
ripple on publication, neither initiated a critical fashion, and neither
survived in its own right, yet each has merit enough to justify
inclusion today in such a series as the Augustan reprints.</p>

<p class="para2">Chesterfield's <i>Letters to his Son</i>, the subject of these two
burlesques, were announced as published on April 7, 1774, scarcely a
year after his death; that they became an immediate best seller, every
schoolboy knows. Reaction to the letters took several modes of
expression. These included comments in conversation by Dr. Johnson and
by George III, as reported by Boswell and by Fanny Burney; in letters,
from Walpole, Mrs. Delaney, Voltaire, and Mrs. Montagu; and in diaries,
such as those of Fanny Burney and John Wesley. Reviewers sprang to words
if not into action. Entire books came to the defence of morality. A
sermon announced "The Unalterable Nature of Vice and Virtue" (a second
edition placed Virtue before Vice); the <i>Monthly Review</i> for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[Pg ii]</a></span> December
1775 praised it: "This sensible and well written discourse is chiefly
directed against the letters of the late Lord Chesterfield, though his
Lordship is not mentioned." All of these approached the subject
directly. Indirect reactions included an ironic <i>Apology for Mrs.
Stanhope</i> (the son's widow, who had sold the letters to James Dodsley
the publisher for £1575 and was represented as the editor), two novels
showing the pernicious effects of the Chesterfieldean "system"&mdash;<i>The
Pupil of Pleasure</i>, by Courtney Melmoth (Samuel Jackson Pratt), and <i>The
Two Mentors</i>, by Clara Reeve&mdash;and a parody by Horace Walpole of the
first three letters (published years later in his <i>Works</i>). The
<i>Westminster Magazine</i> carried a "Petition of the Women of Pleasure" and
the <i>London Chronicle</i> a farcical skit on Lord Chesterfield's refined
manners.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> In a play called <i>The Cozeners</i>, Samuel Foote took advantage
of current interest in Chesterfield to ridicule the graces. Not the
least interesting examples of the indirect reaction to the <i>Letters</i> are
the two verse caricatures or burlesques here reprinted.</p>

<p>The earlier of the two poems, <i>The Graces</i>, bears the date 1774 on the
title page. A second edition of 1775 at first glance appears to be a
reissue with new title page, but minor changes and the straightedge test
are evidence of resetting. The authorship was soon known: <i>The London
Chronicle</i> for February 16-18, quoting 88 lines of the total 170 and
working from the first edition, mentioned that the piece was written by
Mr. Woty, but so far as bibliography was concerned this attribution
remained hidden until recently, for Woty's obituary in the <i>Gentleman's
Magazine</i> for March 1791 omitted mention of <i>The Graces</i>, as did the
<i>DNB</i> and its additional sources, John Nichols' <i>Leicestershire</i> and
David Erskine Baker's <i>Biographia Dramatica</i> (1812 ed.).<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> That Woty
did indeed write <i>The Graces</i> one may assume from his including it in
1780, with minor changes, in <i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>. He too used
the first edition.</p>

<p>Of William Woty's life little need be said; the <i>DNB</i>, relying
essentially on the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, gives the salient events:
after preparing to enter the law, he became companion and a kind of
legal secretary to Washington, Earl Ferrers, who prior to his death in
1778 made Woty independent by establishing an annuity of £150 for him.
His first book of verse was <i>The Sporting Club</i>, 1758; the next, <i>The
Shrubs of Parnassus</i>, by "James Copywell,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[Pg iii]</a></span> he published in 1760. Two
others, which he acknowledged, followed in the next three years; then in
1763 he joined Francis Fawkes in editing <i>The Poetical Calendar</i>, in 12
volumes, to which Samuel Johnson contributed a character sketch of
William Collins (Boswell's <i>Life</i>, ed. Hill-Powell, I, 382). In 1770,
Woty issued a two-volume <i>Poetical Works</i>. The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>,
mentioning four other publications from 1770 to 1775, adds, "and some
other miscellaneous pieces since that time." These, possibly unnamed
because published outside of London, included <i>Poems on Several
Occasions</i>, Derby, 1780 (in which, as noted above, he reprinted <i>The
Graces</i>), <i>Fugitive and Original Poems</i>, Derby, 1786, and <i>Poetical
Amusements</i>, Nottingham, 1789. "Mr. W. was a true <i>bon vivant</i>," the
notice continues, "but by a too great indulgence of his passion for
conviviality and society he unfortunately injured his constitution." He
died in March 1791, "aged about 60."</p>

<p class="para2">Woty seems to have been on the periphery of Samuel Johnson's list of
acquaintances. Under what circumstances Johnson agreed to write the
sketch of Collins for the <i>Poetical Calendar</i>, Boswell does not
specify&mdash;whether for Woty or for Fawkes or for J. Coote, the
publisher&mdash;but write it he did. The index to the Hill-Powell Boswell
lists Woty (and Fawkes) only in this connection, but someone had
sufficient interest with the lexicographer to induce him to subscribe to
Woty's anonymous <i>Shrubs of Parnassus</i>, 1760; the subscription list of
some 500 names includes not only Samuel Johnson, A.M., but David
Garrick, Mr. William Mason, Dr. Smollett, Mr. Strahan, and Mr. Newbery,
of St. Paul's Church Yard, who bought 6 books&mdash;not unnaturally, for he
was the publisher. A decade later, the subscribers to <i>The Poetical
Works of William Woty</i> included James Boswell, Esq., George Colman,
Esq., Mr. Garrick, Dr. Johnson, and this time for but one set, Mr.
Newbery. After still another decade, when Woty published in Derby his
<i>Poems on Several Occasions</i>, the list of subscribers included none of
these names, even though this collection included <i>The Graces</i>, with its
dozen lines on Samuel Johnson (now omitting from page 11 the couplet on
Bute) which reveal no degree of intimacy, but do show respect and
admiration for him.</p>

<p><i>The Fine Gentleman's Etiquette; or, Lord Chesterfield's Advice to his
Son, versified, By a Lady</i>, is both longer and later than <i>The Graces</i>;
unlike that poem, it remains anonymous. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</a></span> lady versifier, though
somewhat repetitious in her matter (her defence would of course be that
she followed her source), cannot be accused of incompetence in her
prosody. Of the 366 lines, she has precious few which scan roughly or
rhyme inaccurately; those few come within legitimate poetic license&mdash;on
the whole, a slightly smoother versification than in Goldsmith's then
popular "Retaliation," dashed off in response to a jest at The Club but
not published until shortly after his death in 1774. Alike in verse
form, the two poems differ significantly in ideas and style; there the
discrepancy justifies the different fates of the two. In the poem here
reprinted, the only passage deserving individual comment is the anecdote
of Philip and the blanc mange (see pages 13 and 14). Lord Charlemont, in
the course of answering a query from Lord Bruce about young Stanhope's
character, recounts the incident, having had it from an eyewitness: the
food was baked gooseberries and whipped cream, and the Earl's comment,
"John, why do you not fetch the strop and the razors? you see your
master is going to shave himself" (<i>Charlemont MSS</i>., I, 327-328).</p>

<p class="para2">The reviewers did little for <i>The Fine Gentleman's Etiquette</i>; most
ignored the pamphlet. <i>The Monthly Miscellany</i> for June 1776 provided a
few kindly lines: "This didactic rhapsody, the precepts contained in
which are founded upon passages referred to in his Lordship's letters,
is written in hendecasyllable measure, and is not destitute of humour."
The <i>Monthly Review</i> for the same month had less to say: "We should be
miserably deficient in the fine Gentleman's Etiquette, were we to
criticise a lady for employing her time as she pleases."</p>

<p>In one sense, both burlesquers hit the weak spot in Chesterfield's
<i>Letters</i>. Since his purpose is to entertain through exaggeration, a
parodist is not required to be fair or to distinguish between an editor
without judgment and the writer of intimate letters; so long as
something can be made ludicrous, 'twill suffice. Yet essentially the
burlesquers and many a critic then and since have missed what
Chesterfield was writing in his letters and living in his long life.
Blinded by the trivia inevitable in hundreds of letters carrying anxious
parental advice, the critics have too often ignored or misinterpreted
Chesterfield's passion for helping. He lavished countless hours, during
the busiest part of his life, writing to his son in an effort to round
out his education where it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[Pg v]</a></span> distressingly deficient&mdash;not in
strengthening it where it was strong. The pattern of trying to help is
repeated: Chesterfield did his level best with his godson; he gave what
was seemly to his young friend Huntingdon and likewise to Solomon
Dayrolles. Five unpublished letters at Yale, to a Mr. Clements of
Dublin, repeat the formula on a minor scale, the fifty-five-year-old
earl laying out a plan of education for the family hopeful.
Chesterfield's interest to do good shows at its best in his too little
known letter to the Duke of Bedford condemning the brutal treatment of
French prisoners (Dobree, VI, 2960). These all reveal something more
praiseworthy in the man than the common interpretation of him.</p>

<p>Refreshing, sophisticatedly unsophisticated, yet genuinely revealing of
Lord Chesterfield's character, are a half dozen unknown couplets which
almost summarize his philosophy of manners. Since his sense of humor can
be questioned only by those themselves blind and deaf to humor, his
dislike here for laughter should be taken for what he intends&mdash;disgust
at vacuous guffaws. The society he praises has fun without attendant
headaches or regrets. Surely, one could do worse than to be, with him,
"innocently gay." The verses appeared in the <i>London Chronicle</i> for May
28-30, 1776; an autograph copy, said to be dated 1761 and forming part
of the Alfred Morrison collection, was sold at auction in 1918.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<h3>Transcriber's Notes</h3>

<p><b>A. "The Graces"</b></p>

<p>On p. 2, extra quotation mark deleted in the phrase "speak distinctly
and gracefully" in footnote 1.</p>

<p>On page 7, "observe e'm all" has been amended to "observe 'em all".</p>

<p>On p. 21 The redundant double quotation mark after "<i>grandure</i>" has been
deleted.<br /><br /></p>


<p><b>B. "The Fine Gentleman's Etiquette"</b></p>

<p>These typos have been amended:</p>

<p>On p. 7, "supprose" has been amended to
"suppose".</p>

<p>On p. 20, "you hand" has been amended to "your hand".</p>

<p>This poem makes much use of quotation marks. It is not always certain
that they have been put in the correct place, but they have been left
unchanged.</p>

<p>In "The Fine Gentleman's Etiquette", there are two sets of footnotes.
One set, which contains references to Chesterfield's Letters, is
anchored with lower-case alphabetic characters, and placed after the
relevant paragraph. The second set is anchored with Arabic numerals and
placed at the end of the poem.</p>

<p>In footnote 4 the word "days" had "s" printed in reverse. This is now
printed the right way round.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
